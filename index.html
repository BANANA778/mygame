                <p>
                others : importent note 
                need to have some kind of visual that they already complete the level(but allow replay)
                
                to- do :
                need a point system of some kind(1 min more -1 point or smt)(maybe use my point as average ans coutinue to save the user's point to average out so it would be on more personal improvement rather then all competing at the same score system but then also provide the averge so they can compere with others too, like the person with 3 average is better then 4 average )
